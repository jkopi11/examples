# Requests

The CRM internal application I created for the Village of Downers Grove

It included reporting using charts and graphs. Maps showing locations and heat maps and the ability to add or pass off requests to other individuals in the Village.

ESRI's ArcGIS Server was used as a means of accessing the datbase becasue it had an extra layer of security.
