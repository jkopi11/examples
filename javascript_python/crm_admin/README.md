# CRM Admin

This was one of the last things I worked on at the Village of Downers.

It was intended to allow power users to send notifications to Mobile users and eventually have other functionality

It used javascript/jquery for the front-end and python to extract the list of mobile users from an ESRI ArcGIS Server.

I used ArcGIS Server because it handled some of the security and allowed for easier integration with our GIS data.
