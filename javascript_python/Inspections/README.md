# Inspections

This project was in response to a request from our Building department wanting to allow residents to submit requests for inspections and then be able to open those requests in our Permitting software. The javascript files were used by a webpage on the Village's CMS.

It used the Google Calendar API to check individuals schedules and then posted the appointments to a general calendar and emailed the individuals that were assigned to the specific permit type. Included in the email was an attachment that would open the permit software to that specific permit.
